# rock-paper-scissors
Second version of a Rock Paper Scissors project by using JavaScript and HTML+CSS.

A basic GUI has already been implemented and the game allows the player to play 5 rounds. Whenever the player or the computer wins 5 rounds, the game resets all counters and a new game starts.

This is an exercise from The Odin Project.

BUGS:

- Whenever the player or the computer win 5 rounds, the game prompts to play again, but the winner counter stays at 4 and won't update to 5. This has been debugged and works fine, although I haven't found a workaround to visibly update the winner's counter.
